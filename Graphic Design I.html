<p>Under the leadership of creative director Wyatt Mitchell, The New Yorker has undergone a new direction in design and content beginning with the publication's Goings on About Town section. Mitchell and his team found inspiration in the magazine's very first issue begun in February of 1925. Under the creative direction of Ray Irvin, these early publications were inspired by the text of Charles Brooks's novel Journeys to Bagdad and the spot illustrations of Allen Lewis. Another dominant image that Mitchell has adopted into The New Yorker's header is 'the wealthy French aristocrat.' Mitchell's principle goal was to modernize the text without losing its whimsical character. How will the development of this new 'fiction' of form influence the meaning, history, and depth of The New Yorker?</p>
<p>While navigating the Goings On About Town section online, the reader will realize that the focus of the content has shifted somewhat to the editorial and curatorial aspects of the art and entertainment spheres. Design, as an evolved form of writing, is a type of rhetoric utilized to manipulate and construct a performative reality. Part of this performance aspect underlies the creation of visual emblems depicted next to the major topics listed below "Happenings This Week." These topics include Food, Theatre, Film, and so on.</p>
<p>Although embodying some of the character and whimsy of the inaugural New Yorker issues, this section of the website seems largely disconnected and bare in comparison to the rest of the page and the magazine as a whole. The stark black and white of the imagery adds clarity but lacks unity. Some of the emblematic icons seem more appropriate then others. For example, the icon for the 'Food' section is a plate atop which rests a fork and knife entwined in a ribbon. This emblem employs a similar line weight as the text. Additionally the use of enclosure and arabesque in the design makes it playful and animated, an apt partner for the redrawn classic Irvin font. However, other icons are far less successful. The emblem for "Above and Beyond" depicts a cornucopia in a flowery half-frame that seems overly complicated and ornate. The line weight is too thin in comparison to the text. The image itself appears fundamentally disconnected.</p>
<p>By contrast, the section "Tonight Ideas On What to Do: Suggestions from our editors via our TWITTER ACCOUNT" has a very strong black and white, graphic portrait of a man in profile. This work is modern yet obviously influenced by 1920's fashion illustration making it particularly suited for the text. However, the orientation of the image is potentially cumbersome. The profile is facing left carrying the viewer's gaze off the page and into ads. Perhaps it would have been more beneficial for the man to be facing right so that the viewer could transition more naturally from image to text. Another irksome point of contention is that the header of the page "Goings on About Town" appears slightly pixilated and grayed out competing with the far bolder text of "The Ballad of Anna Nicole Smith."</p>
<p>Overall, this renovation of The New Yorker is a fantastic way to attract new readers. Although disconnected from many of the topics and neighboring fonts, the renovation of the classic Irvin font adds some humanity and play into an otherwise bland design. Furthermore, the historical weight of the text and illustrations creates more meaning and depth with the experience of reading the publication. Designers will continue to struggle to balance the graphic and stylized elements of Irvin's influence with the naturalism, complexity, and vibrancy of photography and animation that dominate the web. The layering of content over content has reinterpreted The New Yorker in a compelling manner, but has led to tension with the more contemporary reality and between designer, writer, and audience.</p>
